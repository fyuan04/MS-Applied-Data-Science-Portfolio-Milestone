This project aims at building models to detect sarcasm used in news headlines. By doing so, 
we can classify news headlines into two categories based on if they are sarcastic or not. 
Please note that the project codes are divided into two parts, the first notebook contains 
topic modeling and word clouds built. The second includes the machine learning models we built
and model evaluation. Python is required to run both notebooks.
